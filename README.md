# LetsMeetBackend
This repository contains the server-side PHP Rest API used by my iOS app [Let's Meet!](//github.com/gabrieleoliaro/LetsMeet). The app makes SQL requests to the MySql database through GET and POST requests to the urls where the .php files in this repository are stored. Currently, the API is installed on [Gabriele](//github.com/gabrieleoliaro)'s webspace at the address: https://www.gabrieleoliaro.it/db/<file_name.php>
The db_connect file has been edited to avoid revealing the credentials to the MySQL database used by the app.
